# KdTree

This is an algorithmic solution for solving for finding a point nearest to a given search point or for finding all points in a given range for very large sets of points.

The solution uses a k-dimensional tree to efficiently find te nearest point or points in a given range: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree 

A brute force solution is also included. 

The application follows the specs listed here: http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/kdtree.html

The applicaiton requires an external library to be run which can be located here: http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar Or on the Algorithims book site here: http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/
